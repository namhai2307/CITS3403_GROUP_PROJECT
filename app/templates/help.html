          Using the "Add Event" form on the left-hand side of the page. Simply fill in the details for your event, then submit to see it added to your calendar on the right.

    </section>

    <section id="editEvent" class="help-section">
      <h2>Editing an Event</h2>
      <p> After creating a new event, events on the day you currently have selected in the calendar will gain a button to either "Edit" or "Delete" the event. <br>
      "Edit" will open a window within the app to change any of the details for the event. Once you are happy with the new details, simply submit the form and your calendar will be updated. If you have started editing the wrong event, simply save without changing or click the X in the rop right of the window.<br>
      "Delete" will open a banner to confirm that you are are sure you would like to proceed with this action. If you are, simply click "OK" and the event will be removed from your calendar.  
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="colourVis" class="help-section">
      <h2>Why is my Calendar Red?</h2>
      <p>Your calendar uses a heatmap color scheme to visually represent how busy each day is. 
        Days that are less busy will appear in cooler colors like green, while busier days will shift to warmer colors such as yellow, orange, or red. 
        The more hours you have scheduled on a day, the warmer and more intense the color will appear, making it easy to spot your busiest days at a glance.
      </p>

    <section id="addFriend" class="help-section">
      <h2>Adding A Contact</h2>
      <p> Send a friend request to your contacts by searching their username on the <a href='/profile'>Profile</a> tab! The users that best match your search term will be displayed beneath the box, so try to be as close to their username as you can. 
          Then it's simply a matter of clicking the "Add Friend" button to ship off the request for them to review. <br>
        If another user has sent you a friend request, these will appear just beneath the search box when you enter your profile. Simply click "Accept" if you want to link your account to the other user, or "Delete" if you do not.
