      <h2>Adding An Event</h2>
      <p>You can add new events to your calendar using the <a href='/dashboard'>Dashboard</a> tab. <br>
          Using the "Add Event" form on the left-hand side of the page. Simply fill in the details for your event, then submit to see it added to your calendar on the right.
          <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
              <li> Start and End Time: The time period during which the event will occur. End time currently must be on the same day as the start.</li>
              <li> Title: The header for your event that will display beneath the calendar when viewing the day.</li>
              <li> Description: A short description that will be displayed beneath the Title when viewing the day.</li>
              <li> Privacy Level: Decide who can view details of this event: Just yourself, specific friends, or all friends. </li>
          </ul>
          Events on a given day will be displayed beneath the calendar when you click on the appropriate date.

    <section id="editEvent" class="help-section">
      <h2>Editing an Event</h2>
      <p> After creating a new event, events on the day you currently have selected in the calendar will gain a button to either "Edit" or "Delete" the event. <br>
      "Edit" will open a window within the app to change any of the details for the event. Once you are happy with the new details, simply submit the form and your calendar will be updated. If you have started editing the wrong event, simply save without changing or click the X in the rop right of the window.<br>
      "Delete" will open a banner to confirm that you are are sure you would like to proceed with this action. If you are, simply click "OK" and the event will be removed from your calendar. <br>

    <section id="colourVis" class="help-section">
      <h2>Why is my Calendar Red?</h2>
      <p>Your calendar responds to your life, updating to let you know at a glance where your time is most precious. As you add more events to a day, it will change colour on your calendar to easily flag it as busier.
          Days will start out white, and become coloured with darker shades of red based on how many hours of that day are occupied by your events.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="addFriend" class="help-section">
      <h2>Adding A Contact</h2>
      <p> Send a friend request to your contacts by searching their username on the <a href='/profile'>Profile</a> tab! The users that best match your search term will be displayed beneath the box, so try to be as close to their username as you can. 
          Then it's simply a matter of clicking the "Add Friend" button to ship off the request for them to review. <br>
        If another user has sent you a friend request, these will appear just beneath the search box when you enter your profile. Simply click "Accept" if you want to link your account to the other user, or "Delete" if you do not.
